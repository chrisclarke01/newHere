# App.js Format

App.js is the "home page" of the application, so to speak. The home page (splash screen?) is simply the logo breathing in and out with the name of the application below it.

The home screen has a navbar on top that allows the user to view the dashboard and register an account/sign in.

Upon signing in, there will be more options available for users.

# macchieddit

## Introduction
This project is essentially a wannabe Reddit clone; it won't have all the bells and whistles of Reddit, but it will have similar functionality. The primary focus is to specifically upload pictures of coffee, however, you *technically* upload any pictures. But that goes against the spirit of macchieddit!

Essentially, this is a learning project, but something I want to customize. Maybe I'll add more features over time. Who knows.

## Planned Features
As of right now, here are the planned features:
- User authenthentication via email + username + password
- User authorization via admin vs user accounts
- Picture upload linked to uploading user
- CRUD functionality on posts and users
- Main page with *x* most recently uploaded pictures
- Upvote/downvote on posts w/ weighted score dependent on time
- Karma associated with each user

Features that would be cool:
- Auto-populating upon startup with *x* random pictures from library and assigning random scores
- Separate pages for pictures and text posts, and a main page that combines the two
- Auto-populating upon startup with *x* random text posts from library and assigning random scores

## How to Run
- Navigate to *client*
- Run *npm start*

## Technologies Used

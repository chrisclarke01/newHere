# newHere

## Introduction
newHere is a web application designed to help people connect with others in their local area. When moving to a new area, it can be difficult to meet new people. We all want to try new activities, meet new people, and make connections, but it can be intimidating to put yourself out there, especially when you aren't familiar with the local scene. It's especially hard to break into an existing group or scene - sometimes, it can be easier to throw people into a situation and let the connections happen where they happen.

newHere is designed to help that process by allowing individuals to search for common interests and activities, and to be connected with others who are doing the same. Want to go to bar trivia, but don't have a team? newHere will let you form a group from other people wanting to do the same thing. Want to start a DnD campaign? Or go hiking? Or maybe form a book club? newHere will connect you with people who want to explore a common interest.

Here's how it works. If you're using newHere, you want to do something with other people, but you don't know enough people to do the thing. Using newHere, you'd simply have to search for the type of activity you want to do and the location you want to do it. For example: disc golf in Raleigh, NC. You'll find posts from others who want to make a group to do that too.

If you search your activity and city and don't see any postings, simply make one yourself, and wait for people to sign up. newHere is unique in that nobody's identity is shared until enough people have signed up. This is to avoid groups forming over time, reinforcing the "clique" effect. In addition, the creator of the group posting will never be revealed by newHere; again, this is to avoid any awkwardness in people assuming a "de facto" organizer. Of course, the organizer can reveal themselves to the group, however newHere as a platform will not do this automatically.
